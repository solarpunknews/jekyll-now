title: Puerto Rico Recovery efforts due to Hurricane Maria.

---

There was widespread damage done in Puerto Rico due to the category 4 hurricane that passed through in September. There has 
been much criticism directed at the response of the United States government, especially directed at the lackaidasical 
President Donald Trump. Trump who, as of this writing, has still not rolled out any aid packages visited the island earlier 
this week. This visit included the President telling the Puerto Rican people how expensive rescue efforts have been and the 
now infamous throwing of the paper towels.

Over 90% of the island of Puerto Rico is still without power. It is imperative that people help with the efforts to help the 
people of Puerto Rico. There have been numerous private citizens and faith organizations who are helping with the efforts but 
there is still more work to be done.
