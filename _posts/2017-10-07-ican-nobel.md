title: ICAN wins Nobel Peace Proze 2017
---
The International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons(ICAN) has been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.

ICAN was instrumental in getting 122 countries to adopt the UN Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons. However none of the countries 
with known nuclear power signed the treaty.

With the growing Nuclear threat of North Korea and the growing instability of US President Trump, it is now more important than ever
for Nuclear disarmament to become a reality.
