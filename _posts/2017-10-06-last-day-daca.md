title: #CLEANDREAMACT

October 5th was the final day to file for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrival (DACA) protection. Now undocumented 
and documented young people alike are looking towards the possibility of immigration legislation that will allow for a path to
citizenship and allow young people to work and study in the United States. 

A 'clean' Dream Act would mean that whatever legislation is passed would not include provisions which would further criminalize
the immigrant community. The precdedent that has been set so far is that immigration bills include defense spending in the form 
of money for law enforcement at the border and 'The Wall' (not to be confused with the 1979 Pink Floyd prog-rock masterpiece)
Donald Trumps conceptualization of American nationalism.
