title: Will Puerto Rico Be Rebuilt in the Solar Image?
---
<p><a href="https://insideclimatenews.org/news/06102017/elon-musk-puerto-rico-solar-microgrids-rossello-rebuild-power-grid">Reports</a> have 
surfaced that Elon Musk is considering rebuilding the Puerto Rican electrical using solar technology.</p>

<p>Musk's company Tesla sent workers to install Powerwalls on the island in order to alleviate the fact that almost <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/US/hurricane-maria-95-percent-puerto-rico-power/story?id=50276834">95% of 
Puerto Ricans are without power</a>. 
However, building an entirely new electrical grid would be another question entirely. The governor of Puerto Rico, Ricardo Rossello,
personally tweeted Musk to bring the solar technology to Puerto Rico. Musk tweeted back "Let's Talk".</p>

<p>This is hopeful news for renewable energy evangelists and those who want to see Puerto Rico rebuilt stronger and more 
sustainable. However this would not be something that would relieve the 95 percent who currently don't have power, it would be
something to consider once the island does begin to determine how to rebuild it's infrastructure. We at Solar Punk News will 
be there every step of the way.</p>
