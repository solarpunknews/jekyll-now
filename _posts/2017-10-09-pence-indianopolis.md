title: VP Pence's publicity stunt cost American Taxpayers a quarter of a million dollars
---
Though Trump reminded the Puerto Rican people about how much money was being used on recovery efforts on his recent trip October 3rd,
he had no problem spending an estimated $250,000 so that Vice President Pence could fly out to Indianapolis and leave early.

If you're going to fly all the way to Indianopolis for a Colt's game you might as well stay and watch the whole thing through! Instead Pence
thought it was appropriate to make a statement, so is his first amendment right. But instead of taking the time to repudiate Charlottesville 
white nationalists, or to rally people to help in the recovery efforts of the numerous hurricane ravaged areas in the United States and its 
territories, the Vice President felt it was more important to attack others first amendement right. 

It is terrifying to see what gets prioritized by the executive branch of the American government, and we at Solar Punk News 
think these social conservative Republicans should cut unneccesary spending and instead use taxpayer funds to help the American people.
How many regular Americans can afford to go to a football game? Why should our elected representatives be allowed to spend so 
much leisure time while there are people in Puerto Rico who dont't even have power or water? Make America prioritize it's people
over the oligarchy for the very first time.
